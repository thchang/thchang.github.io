    title: ParMOO
    subtitle: Python library for parallel multiobjective simulation optimization
    year: 2023
    author: T. H. Chang (lead), S. M. Wild, and H. Dickinson
    version: 0.2.0
    language: Python 3
    git: https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo
    description: >
            The multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) is a generalization
            of the single objective optimization problem.
            Instead of attempting to minimize a single cost or loss function,
            a MOP attempts to balance the tradeoff between multiple,
            potentially conflicting criteria.
            The solution to a MOP is a set of nondominated points describing
            the tradeoff between the conflicting objectives, called the Pareto
            front.
            In a multiobjective simulation optimization problem, the cost
            functions are derived from computationally expensive numerical
            simulations.
            Example applications include
            aerospace design engineering,
            material and drug manufacturing,
            and particle accelerator design.

            ParMOO is a Python framework for solving multiobjective simulation
            optimization problems, by exploiting the underlying structure of
            the simulation.
            In order to achieve scalability on extreme-scale hardware, ParMOO
            layers over the libEnsemble library.

    title: VTMOP
    subtitle: Solver for blackbox multiobjective optimization problems
    year: 2022
    author: T. H. Chang (sole)
    language: Fortran 2008
    git: https://github.com/vtopt/VTMOP
    description: >
        VTMOP is a flexible open-source Fortran package for solving generic
        MOPs; see ParMOO (above) for a description of MOPs.
        While many current MOP algorithms do not scale well for more than
        2 or 3 objectives, VTMOP aims at approximating tradeoff curves between
        larger numbers of objectives.
        VTMOP is targeted at large scale multidisciplinary design optimization
        problems, such as particle accelerator design optimization
        and aerospace engineering design applications.
        This work was partially funded by a DOE SCGSR award, in
        collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory (see awards).

        The original VTMOP source code is implemented in Fortran 2008, using
        OpenMP to issue simulation tasks asynchronously.
        However, a VTMOP generator function is also available for Python usage
        through the libEnsemble library.

    title: DelaunaySparse
    subtitle: Interpolation via a sparse subset of the Delaunay triangulation
    year: 2020
    author: T. H. Chang (lead) and T. C. H. Lux
    language: Fortran 2003
    git: https://github.com/vtopt/DelaunaySparse
    description: >
        The Delaunay triangulation is a well-studied simplicial mesh,
        widely considered optimal for interpolation applications.
        Delaunay triangulations have recently garnered some interest in
        the machine learning community, for their interpretability in the
        context of regression and classification problems.
        Unfortunately, the "curse of dimensionality" manifests in the
        size of the Delaunay triangulation, making it uncomputable for
        high-dimensional big data problems.

        DELAUNAYSPARSE is an open-source Fortran package that computes
        sparse subsets of the complete Delaunay triangulation, as needed
        to perform interpolation.
        The resulting codebase is fast, robust, and portable; and features
        both serial and parallel implementations.
        Interfaces are available for usage as a Fortran library,
        C/C++ library, Python module, or from the command line.

    title: QAML
    subtitle: Quantum annealing math library
    year: 2019
    author: T. C. H. Lux (lead), T. H. Chang, and S. S. Tipirneni
    language: Python 3
    git: https://github.com/tchlux/qaml
    description: >
        Quantum annealing (QA) is an implementation of the general purpose
        adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) model for quantum computing.
        QA balances the theoretical properties of AQC against real-world
        practicalities, allowing for faster progress in near-term QA hardware.

        QAML is an open-source Python project, which embeds least squares
        and polynomial sum-of-squares problems (with real, integer, Boolean
        or mixed variables) on the D-Wave quantum annealer.
        These broad classes of problems are ubiquitous in scientific computing,
        machine learning, and data science.
