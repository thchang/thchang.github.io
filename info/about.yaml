- bio:
    short: >
        I am currently a Postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory in the
        Mathematics and Computer Science Division.
        I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2020,
        where my dissertation was "Mathematical Software for Multiobjective
        Optimization Problems."
    research-intro: >
        I develop frameworks and algorithms at the intersection
        of optimization, approximation theory, and machine learning.
        I apply these tools on scientific applications such as
        material manufacturing, aerospace engineering, and HPC tuning.
        My active areas of research are
    interests:
        - numerical optimization
        - machine learning
        - computational geometry
        - analysis of algorithms
        - scientific software

    what: >
        I am interested in solving scientific problems by combining
        techniques from blackbox optimization, approximation theory, and
        machine learning.
    why: >
        Owing to decades of research and careful analysis, many techniques
        in blackbox optimization and approximation theory are easy to
        interpret and verify.
        These properties are important in many scientific settings
        such as mission-critical deployments and exploratory research.
        However, some of these techniques are not scalable or flexible
        enough for usage in modern applications,
        which can be high-dimensional, overparameterized, and may
        involve complex design or action spaces.
        On the other hand, modern machine learning has been extremely
        successful in scaling to large complex problems by using
        computationally cheap heuristics for extracting structure from
        large volumes of high-dimensional data.
    goals: "The goals of my research are to:"
    goals-list:
        - design flexible and scalable algorithms for leveraging blackbox
          optimization and numerical approximation techniques
          in modern settings;
        - create hybrid machine learning/numerical algorithms, techniques, and
          frameworks to exploit structure in complex, overparameterized
          problems;
        - improve our understanding of the behavior of classical numerical
          methods in complex, high-dimensional domains; and
        - make these hybrid techniques accessible to the general public
          through the production of high-quality scientific software.
    examples: "Some examples of my past and ongoing work include:"
    examples-list:
        - multiobjective optimization of computationally expensive simulations
          and experiments,
        - multivariate interpolation of high-dimensional scientific and
          engineering data,
        - designing fast and scalable algorithms for computing subsets of
          the Delaunay triangulation in high-dimensional spaces, and
        - implementation of portable and maintainable open-source
          scientific software packages.
