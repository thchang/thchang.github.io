    now: >
        I am currently building high-performance EDA products.
        I still perform
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XvFLOWsAAAAJ&hl=en">
        research in numerical optimization, scientific machine learning, and HPC</a>
        and maintain <a href="https://github.com/thchang">open source software</a>
        independently.
    before: >
        Previously, I was a Postdoc @
        <a href="https://www.anl.gov/mcs/lans">Argonne</a>,
        where I developed algorithms and open source numerical software
        and performed applied research at
        the interface of numerical optimization, approximation theory,
        and scientific machine learning.
        Before that, I completed my PhD in Computer Science (specialization in
        scientific computing) @
        <a href="https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>.

    what: >
        I combine techniques from optimization, approximation theory,
        and machine learning in order to guide
        scientific experimentation and model complex real-world phenomena.
    why: >
        Owing to decades of research and careful analysis, many techniques
        in model-based optimization and approximation theory are easy to
        interpret and verify.
        These properties are essential in many scientific applications
        such as mission-critical control and exploratory research.
        However, some of these techniques are not scalable or flexible
        enough for modern applications,
        which can be high-dimensional, overparameterized, and may
        involve complex design or action spaces.
        On the other hand, modern machine learning has been extremely
        successful in scaling to large complex problems by using
        computationally cheap heuristics for extracting structure from
        data.
        My work facilitates reliable, interpretable, and
        structure-exploiting machine learning to drive
        scientific discovery and engineering system design.
    goals: "Specifically, my goals are to:"
    goals-list:
        - design algorithms and frameworks for applying model-based
          optimization and numerical approximation techniques
          in latent-space representations of complex domains;
        - improve our understanding of the behavior of classical numerical
          methods in complex, high-dimensional domains; and
        - make these hybrid techniques accessible to the general public
          through the production of high-quality scientific software.
    examples: "Some examples of my past and ongoing work include:"
    examples-list:
        - multiobjective optimization and active learning problems
          involving time-consuming simulations and experiments,
        - predictive modeling with limited amounts of high-dimensional
          scientific and engineering data,
        - design and analysis of algorithms for numerical modeling
          in complex domains, and
        - development of software packages for optimization and geometric
          interpolation.
